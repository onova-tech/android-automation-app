## Quick Start

This skill activates automatically when you:
- Start work on a Linear ticket (e.g., "I'm starting {{TICKET_PREFIX}}-447")
- Create a commit or branch
- Ask about PR workflow or contribution guidelines
- Reference CONTRIBUTING.md

## What This Skill Does

Enforces SAFe-compliant development workflow with proper branch naming (`{{TICKET_PREFIX}}-{number}-{description}`), standardized commit messages (type, scope, description), and rebase-first git workflow. Ensures all work is traceable to Linear tickets.
